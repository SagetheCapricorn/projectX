# This file handles the express routing portion of our code.'

## What we Have so far
Currently we have a database architecture setup for the dummy data but need to change to fit real info.
This routuing also isnt complete so far we only have one DOA and one route. Need to add more routes and possibly another DOA.

### Where are things
Routes are written in the ./api folder we only have the basic / route. 



####
Still not sure if we need express but gonna set it up anyway and look to convert to serverless at the end.
