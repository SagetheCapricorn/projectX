This is the birth of our project. Kevin and I shall enrich our skills by making something cool.

# Initial idea we make a react webscrapper
## We want to add in CI/CD just for fun theres no real reason but it would be a cool addition
Few things to setup first:
First we need to link github ti circleci with  githooks 
Then we need to setup express and mongo connections
then we need to link react to expresss 
I think this is the proper order
Make everything async if possible?
best practices?
